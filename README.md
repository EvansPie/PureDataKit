# PureDataKit

PureDataKit is a lightweight library designed to integrate Pure Data (PD) audio synthesis and signal processing capabilities into iOS applications. This library leverages the work of the authors from the `libpd/pd-for-ios` project to provide a convenient and easy-to-use interface for embedding Pure Data functionality in iOS projects.

Please note that I do not own any copyrights to the underlying library or the Pure Data components. All credit and copyrights belong to the original authors of `libpd/pd-for-ios` (https://github.com/libpd/pd-for-ios), who have done exceptional work in creating and maintaining this powerful tool. PureDataKit simply wraps their work to make it accessible to iOS developers in a streamlined manner.
