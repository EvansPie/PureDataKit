  "summary": "A lightweight library designed to integrate Pure Data (PD) audio synthesis and signal processing capabilities into iOS applications.",
  "description": "PureDataKit is a lightweight package designed to bridge the `lib-pd` static library in a Pod or Swift Package. This library leverages the work of the authors from the libpd/pd-for-ios project to provide a convenient and easy-to-use interface for embedding Pure Data functionality in iOS projects.\n\nPlease note that I do not own any copyrights to the underlying library or the Pure Data components. All credit and copyrights belong to the original authors of libpd/pd-for-ios, who have done exceptional work in creating and maintaining this powerful tool. PureDataKit simply wraps their work to make it accessible to iOS developers in a streamlined manner.",
